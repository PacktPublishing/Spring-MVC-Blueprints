Some of your apps will require the same dependencies to be loaded before they can run. jQuery UI is a good example of this. 
Instead of having multiple copies of jQUI in each of those app folder, just put them in universal.

Kickstrap will load all universal files first, then it looks in your apps, loads the required dependencies in your apps. For each app whose required resources are loaded, its 
dependent resources (the second line) are then loaded.

Put your universal dependencies in here and list them in config.ks. You don't need to put "universal" in your list of apps. They will be added automatically.

KS WINDOW

This is something new we're testing which allows apps to reuse a simulated window.
